# Story Quest - Interactive Story Adventure

## FBLA Introduction to Programming 2024-25

**Created by Pranav Behal from Cumberland Valley High School**

An interactive storytelling application where users engage with AI companions across unique missions, with their choices shaping the narrative.

### üìã FBLA Prompt & Program Correlation

**Original Prompt:**
"Write an interactive story that occasionally asks the user what they'd like to do, and changes where the story goes based on user input. Allow the user to stop interacting with the story by saying 'stop.'"

**How Story Quest Addresses & Exceeds the Prompt:**

1. **Core Requirement: Interactive Story**

   - ‚úì Implemented an interactive storyline
   - ‚úì Story adapts dynamically based on the user's decisions on what to do next
   - ‚úì "Stop" command functionality to stop interacting with the story

2. **Going Above & Beyond:**

   - **AI Integration**

     - Advanced language model for dynamic responses
     - Voice synthesis for character dialogue
     - Real-time background generation matching story context

   - **Rich User Experience**

     - Implemented four unique storylines instead of just one
     - Users can freely interact using natural language, rather than just occasional choices
     - Visual character representations
     - Progress tracking and achievements
     - Comprehensive help system
     - Interactive tutorial

   - **Data & Progress**

     - Persistent progress tracking
     - Detailed statistics and visualization
     - Exportable mission data
     - Cross-mission continuity

   - **Technical Excellence**
     - Modern web technologies
     - Responsive design
     - Robust error handling
     - Secure authentication

While the basic prompt asked for a simple interactive story with a stop function, Story Quest is a fully-functioning application that turned this concept into an immersive adventure platform with AI-powered interactions, visual and audio elements, and comprehensive progress tracking.
